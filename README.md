# House-Price-Prediction
This project is a House Price Prediction website. 
## Step - 1
Here I have first built a Model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.
## Step - 2
In second step I have created Python Flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests.
## Step - 3
Last I have built a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, that allows user to enter home square ft area, no. of BHK, bathrooms, location etc and it will call Python Flask server to retrieve the predicted price.

## Technology and Tools Used:
1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, Visual Studio Code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
